                <p><em>Severance</em> is a science fiction psychological thriller series on Apple TV+, created by Dan Erickson and directed by Ben Stiller and Aoife McArdle, set at Lumon Industries in the fictional town of Kier. The series explores a severance procedure that surgically divides employees’ work (“innies”) and personal (“outies”) memories, focusing on Mark Scout (Adam Scott), a former history professor leading the Macrodata Refinement (MDR) team. Season 1 (2022) follows Mark and his team—Helly Riggs (Britt Lower), Dylan George (Zach Cherry), and Irving Bailiff (John Turturro)—as they navigate Lumon’s sterile, maze-like severed floor, sorting “scary numbers.” Helly’s rebellion and Petey Kilmer’s reintegration spark a conspiracy, culminating in an “overtime contingency” breach, exposing innies to the outside world at a gala, Mark’s home, and Burt’s doorstep, revealing Ms. Casey (Dichen Lachman) as Mark’s supposedly dead wife, Gemma. The season ends on a cliffhanger, with the team’s worlds irreversibly altered.</p>
                <p>Season 2 (2025), picking up after the breach, sees Mark return to Lumon under pressure from Seth Milchick, facing new MDR members and a falsified narrative of fame. It delves into the fallout, introducing characters like Gwendoline Christie’s goat-tending Mammalian and deepening the mystery of severance’s purpose through Mark’s search for Helly, reunions with Burt, and uncovering secrets like the goat room and “Cold Harbor” project. The season progresses with Mark infiltrating the testing floor, confronting a preteen manager, and testing severance limits, all while Cobel plots revenge. It ends with Mark torn between saving Gemma or joining Helly’s rebellion against Jame Eagan’s expansion plans, leaving a cliffhanger as the innies fight for control, with Season 3 confirmed on March 21, 2025. The show blends influences from <em>The Stanley Parable</em>, <em>Office Space</em>, and <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, winning Emmys for Main Title Design and Musical Score in 2022.</p>
                <p class="trivia"><em>Trivia:</em> Inspired by Erickson’s office job woes, the series has been praised for its unique premise and atmospheric design.</p>

                <p>The series opens with Mark Scout finding Helly Riggs unconscious on a conference table at Lumon Industries, marking her chaotic introduction to the severed floor. As the MDR team leader, he guides her through the disorienting onboarding process, explaining how severance splits their work and personal memories into separate lives. Helly’s initial bewilderment mirrors Mark’s own suppressed grief over his wife Gemma’s supposed death, though he masks it with a veneer of corporate cheerfulness. Outside, a disheveled Petey Kilmer, Mark’s former colleague who has somehow reintegrated his memories, approaches him in a parking lot and slips him a cryptic card hinting at Lumon’s dark underbelly. This encounter plants the first seeds of doubt in Mark, setting the stage for a slow unraveling of the company’s sterile facade.</p>
